# Data Science Project Portfolio
This is a repository containing data science projects I have completed for the purposes of practice and as a skills showcase.  All projects are created in Python and uploaded as iPython Notebooks.

## Contents

   -[Predicting True Exoplanets](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/matthewkarnes/Data-Projects/blob/master/Kepler_Classification/Kepler_Classification.ipynb) : A model to predict whether an exoplanet detected by the NASA is a false positive or a true exoplanet.  Uses publicly available data from NASA.
   
   -[Determining Best Features to Predict Critical Temperatures](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/matthewkarnes/Data-Projects/blob/master/Superconductivity_Regression/superconductivity_crit_temp_regression.ipynb) : Using different combinations of features and models to determine the best model for predicting the critical temperature of various materials.
   
   -[Classifying Cracked Concrete using a Neural Network](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/matthewkarnes/Data-Projects/blob/master/Concrete_CNN/Concrete_CNN.ipynb) : Creation of a convolutional neural network to classify images based on if they are of cracked or uncracked concrete.
   
   -[Exoplanet Segmentation Model](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/matthewkarnes/Data-Projects/blob/master/Exoplanet_Clustering/Exoplanet_Clustering_rework.ipynb) : Successfully created an unsupervised K-Means clustering model to segment exoplanets by radius and mass, into the four types of exoplanet as defined by NASA.
    
   Tools: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Seaborn, matplotlib, Tensorflow
  
  Note: In the case that the files do not load and give the error "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" please copy the file's github url and paste into                https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/. This is an issue in github's backend that often occurs with Jupyter Notebooks.
